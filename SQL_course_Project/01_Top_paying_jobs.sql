Key highlights:
A Data Analyst role is surprisingly the top earner at $650,000, possibly due to a niche industry, seniority mislabel, or equity compensation.
Leadership roles like Director of Analytics and Associate Director â€“ Data Insights follow with strong salaries above $250K.
Even mid-level roles (e.g., Marketing Data Analyst) can command high pay when domain expertise is valued.
