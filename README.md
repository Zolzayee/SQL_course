## üß© Background

The inception of this project was rooted in a personal objective: to **decode the dynamics** of the data analyst job market and tailor my skill-building roadmap accordingly. I sought to understand:

- üíº Which job roles command the highest compensation?
- üõ† What are the most in-demand skills?
- üß† Which capabilities bridge the gap between **high salary** and **high market demand**?

üîç The dataset powering this analysis is sourced from **Luke Barousse‚Äôs SQL course** ([insert course link here]), which offers comprehensive job posting data ‚Äî spanning titles, salaries, geographic locations, and required technical competencies.

### Key Questions Explored:
1. üí∞ What are the top-paying data analyst roles?
2. üß© What skills are required for these top-tier jobs?
3. üìà Which skills are in the highest demand?
4. üéì Which skills correlate with elevated salaries?
5. üéØ What are the most strategic skills to develop for maximum market impact?

## üîç Analysis Approach

Each SQL query in this project was designed to surgically examine a specific facet of the data analyst job landscape. Below is a breakdown of the analytical process:


### üí∏ 1. Top-Paying Data Analyst Roles
By filtering remote job listings and sorting by salary, I isolated the most financially rewarding opportunities for data analysts.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact
WHERE
    job_title = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### üõ† 2. Skills Required for Top-Paying Jobs
By joining job and skill datasets, I identified which technical competencies are consistently associated with high-paying roles.

```sql 
-- Gets the top 10 paying Data Analyst jobs
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.job_id,
    top_paying_jobs.job_title,
    top_paying_jobs.salary_year_avg,
    skills_dim.skills
FROM
    top_paying_jobs
    INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN
    skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    top_paying_jobs.salary_year_avg DESC;
```

### üìä 3. Most In-Demand Skills
This query quantifies skill frequency across postings to reveal what the market values most for data analyst roles.

```sql 
SELECT
  skills_dim.skills,
  COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM
  job_postings_fact
  INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
  INNER JOIN
    skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
  job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY
  skills_dim.skills
ORDER BY
  demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### üíº 4. Skills with the Highest Salary Potential
This analysis uncovers which individual skills are most closely tied to elevated compensation levels.

```sql 
SELECT
  skills_dim.skills AS skill,
  ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg),2) AS avg_salary
FROM
  job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN
  skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN
  skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
  job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
  AND job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  skills_dim.skills
ORDER BY
  avg_salary DESC;
```

### üß† 5. Strategic Skills: High Salary + High Demand
By blending salary and demand metrics, this final query surfaces the skills offering the best of both worlds ‚Äî strong compensation and employer demand.

```sql 
WITH skills_demand AS (
  SELECT
    skills_dim.skill_id,
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
  FROM
    job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN
    skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
  WHERE
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_postings_fact.job_location = 'Anywhere'
  GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skill_id
),
average_salary AS (
  SELECT
    skills_job_dim.skill_id,
    AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg) AS avg_salary
  FROM
    job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
  WHERE
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_postings_fact.job_location = 'Anywhere'
  GROUP BY
    skills_job_dim.skill_id
)
SELECT
  skills_demand.skills,
  skills_demand.demand_count,
  ROUND(average_salary.avg_salary, 2) AS avg_salary
FROM
  skills_demand
  INNER JOIN
  average_salary ON skills_demand.skill_id = average_salary.skill_id
ORDER BY
  demand_count DESC,
  avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Each query not only served to answer a specific question but also to improve my understanding of SQL and database analysis. Through this project, I learned to leverage SQL's powerful data manipulation capabilities to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.
